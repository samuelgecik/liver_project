# Hepatocyte Ballooning Detection in Liver Ultrasound Images: Phase 1 Documentation

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning system for automatically detecting hepatocyte ballooning in liver ultrasound images. The goal is to assist in the diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using AI-driven image analysis.

### Key Objectives
- Implement deep learning models for multi-class classification of hepatocyte ballooning
- Address significant class imbalance in the dataset
- Utilize transfer learning with medical imaging-specific pre-trained models
- Prepare methodology and results sections for a potential research paper

## Dataset

### Classes
- None (0): Normal liver cells
- Few Balloon Cells (1): Minor hepatocyte ballooning
- Many Cells/Prominent Ballooning (2): Significant hepatocyte ballooning

### Initial Distribution
- None: 906 images
- Few: 5740 images
- Many: 105 images

### Class Imbalance
The dataset exhibits severe class imbalance, particularly for the 'Many' class, which poses a significant challenge for model training and evaluation.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

#### Two-Phase Augmentation Strategy
1. First Phase (Saved Augmentations):
   - Random rotations (limited to 15 degrees)
   - Horizontal flips
   - Random shifts and scaling
   - Intensity adjustments
   - Elastic transformations (for 'Many' class)

2. Second Phase (During Training):
   - Subtle shifts and intensity changes
   - Gaussian noise

#### Implementation
- Used Albumentations library for efficient image augmentations
- Implemented custom Dataset and DataLoader classes for on-the-fly augmentation

### Model Development

#### Deep Learning Models Implemented
1. InceptionV3 (pre-trained)
2. ResNet50 (pre-trained)
3. DenseNet121 (pre-trained)
4. EfficientNetB0 (trained from scratch)

#### Transfer Learning
- Utilized pre-trained weights from RadImageNet for applicable models

### Training Strategy

- Implemented class weighting to address imbalance
- Used custom dataset class for efficient, on-the-fly augmentation
- Employed balanced batch sampling

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Sensitivity (per class and average)
- Specificity (per class and average)
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix analysis

## Results Summary

### Best Performing Model: InceptionV3
- Validation Accuracy: 87.26% (Epoch 26)
- Best AUC: 0.8344 (Epoch 26)

### Model Performance Overview

| Model         | Best Val Accuracy | Best AUC | Best Epoch |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| InceptionV3   | 87.26%            | 0.8344   | 26         |
| ResNet50      | 85.63%            | 0.7917   | 27         |
| DenseNet121   | 86.67%            | 0.7990   | 29         |
| EfficientNetB0| 83.63%            | 0.6693   | 25         |

### Class-wise Performance (Best Epoch)

| Class | Sensitivity | Specificity |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| None  | 97.13%      | 31.19%      |
| Few   | 38.10%      | 100%        |
| Many  | 30.39%      | 97.18%      |

## Challenges and Observations

1. Severe class imbalance, particularly for the 'Many' class, impacting model performance
2. Fluctuating performance on the 'Many' class across epochs
3. Potential overfitting observed in later epochs for some models
4. Trade-off between overall accuracy and minority class detection

## Technical Implementation

- Framework: PyTorch
- Primary Libraries: torchvision, Albumentations
- Hardware: NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti GPU

## Next Steps

1. Implement stratified cross-validation for more robust performance estimation
2. Explore ensemble methods to leverage strengths of different models
3. Further optimize data augmentation and class balancing techniques
4. Investigate decision boundary optimization for clinical relevance
5. Prepare for extending the dataset with newly provided images
