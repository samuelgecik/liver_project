Phase 3 Summary: Machine Learning Models for Hepatocyte Ballooning Detection

Objective:
The goal of this phase was to implement and evaluate various traditional machine learning models for the detection of hepatocyte ballooning in liver ultrasound images, building upon the deep learning approaches from previous phases.

Dataset:
- Three classes: Few (0), Many (1), None (2)
- Class distribution: Few (6232 samples), Many (256 samples), None (2236 samples)
- Significant class imbalance, particularly for the 'Many' class

Models Implemented:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Random Forest
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. XGBoost

Methodology:
1. Feature Extraction:
   - Used pre-trained deep learning models from previous phases as feature extractors

2. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Employed RandomizedSearchCV for efficient hyperparameter optimization
   - Custom scoring function to handle class imbalance and provide comprehensive evaluation

3. Cross-Validation:
   - Implemented 10-fold stratified cross-validation for robust performance estimation

4. Evaluation Metrics:
   - Accuracy, AUC, F1-score
   - Sensitivity and Specificity (per class and average)
   - AUC for Normal vs Abnormal and Few vs Many (preparation for double dichotomy)

Results Summary:

1. KNN:
   - Accuracy: 0.9740
   - AUC: 0.9862
   - F1-score: 0.9737
   - AUC (Normal vs Abnormal): 0.9866
   - AUC (Few vs Many): 0.9803

2. Random Forest:
   - Accuracy: 0.9740
   - AUC: 0.9906
   - F1-score: 0.9736
   - AUC (Normal vs Abnormal): 0.9909
   - AUC (Few vs Many): 0.9874

3. SVM:
   - Accuracy: 0.9677
   - AUC: 0.9918
   - F1-score: 0.9678
   - AUC (Normal vs Abnormal): 0.9923
   - AUC (Few vs Many): 0.9937

4. XGBoost:
   - Accuracy: 0.9731
   - AUC: 0.9898
   - F1-score: 0.9727
   - AUC (Normal vs Abnormal): 0.9905
   - AUC (Few vs Many): 0.9860

Key Findings:
1. All models demonstrated high performance, with accuracies above 96% and AUC scores above 0.98.
2. Random Forest and XGBoost showed slightly better overall performance compared to KNN and SVM.
3. SVM exhibited the highest AUC scores for both Normal vs Abnormal and Few vs Many classifications.
4. All models handled the class imbalance well, showing good performance across all classes.
5. The 'Many' class, despite being the minority, was classified with high specificity across all models.

Challenges Addressed:
1. Class Imbalance: Implemented custom scoring and evaluation metrics to ensure fair assessment across all classes.
2. High-Dimensional Data: Utilized feature extraction from deep learning models to create meaningful input for traditional ML algorithms.
3. Model Comparison: Standardized evaluation metrics and cross-validation strategy for fair comparison across different model types.

Conclusions:
The traditional machine learning approaches implemented in this phase have shown excellent performance in hepatocyte ballooning detection, comparable to the deep learning models from previous phases. The high AUC scores for both Normal vs Abnormal and Few vs Many classifications suggest that these models are well-suited for the planned double dichotomy approach.

Next Steps:
1. Implement and evaluate the double dichotomy classification approach.
2. Conduct a detailed comparison between the single-stage and double dichotomy approaches.
